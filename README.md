# Forest_fire
Introduction
This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project focused on predicting forest fires. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately anticipate the likelihood of a forest fire based on various factors. we use different classification models to predict the output based on given features.

1.Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of historical records of forest fires, including various attributes such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, rain, and more. The data is collected from reliable sources and covers a range of geographic locations and time periods. It is preprocessed to ensure quality and relevance for training our predictive model.

2.EDA

In EDA we analyse all data thoroughly.we see missing values,datatypes,differnt features like num feature and catgorical feature.Also i see differnt relation between output and input feature,pairplots etc.

3.Feature Engineering

The success of any machine learning model heavily relies on feature engineering. In this project, we carefully select, transform, and engineer relevant features from the dataset to provide the best input for our predictive model. Feature scaling, standardization, and handling of missing data are some of the preprocessing steps undertaken to ensure the model's performance.

4.Model Selection

To predict forest fires accurately, we experiment with several machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, support vector classification,logistic regression,KNN,NBB near about all classification algorithems. We train and fine-tune these models using the preprocessed dataset, optimizing their hyperparameters to achieve the best performance. The chosen model demonstrates the highest predictive accuracy and generalization.

5.Evaluation

The performance of the predictive model is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, we utilize techniques like cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness and its ability to generalize well to new, unseen data. Visualization tools are employed to provide insights into the model's behavior and predictions.
